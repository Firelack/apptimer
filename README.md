# **Application to create a personalized routine.** <br>

### Backup of built-in routines, possible modifications of routines (exercises), and order (exercises and routines),and obvioulsy, you can launch the routines

Differents versions :
- languageversion.py : Routines gestion with a good interface, and in this version you can select a language (french and english)
- fonctionbase.py : Just routines in python without interface
- routineapp.py : Routines gestion with interface (but ugly)
- betterinterface.py : Routines gestion with a good interface (french)

**Warning** : If timer go too fast, restart the app. I have absolutely no ideas why it's happend some time...


For now comments and some fonctions names are in french. \
If I have the time, I will try to pass all the app code in english.
